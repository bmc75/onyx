# Onyx Setup

Onyx is a hackable WordPress theme. It is meant to work hand in hand with the [Slate framework](https://github.com/bmc75/slate). This theme is the bare minimum requirements to get started building a WordPress website. The idea is that no two designs are the same and for things like post pages it can take as much time to modify a premade solution than to just create it or import it from a pattern library.
